# React Component UI Update Issue with Tailwind CSS

This repository demonstrates a bug where a React component using Tailwind CSS fails to update the UI correctly after a state change. The counter increments in the background, but the visual display does not reflect these changes.

## Bug Description
The provided `MyComponent` uses Tailwind CSS for styling.  When the 'Increment' button is clicked, the `count` state variable correctly updates, but the UI displaying the value of `count` does not reflect this update. This issue arises from a potential misunderstanding of React's state management or interaction with Tailwind's virtual DOM.

## Bug Solution
The solution involves ensuring that React re-renders the component whenever the `count` state variable changes. By making sure that `count` is appropriately used within the component's JSX and that React's mechanisms for updating the UI are followed correctly, the UI will accurately reflect the changes in the state.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
4. Observe that clicking the 'Increment' button does not visually change the counter display.

## Solution
The solution is available in `bugSolution.js`. This version correctly renders the updated count. This usually involves using React's state management appropriately.
